# BS Plus Chatintegrations Web Manager
+ a simple tool to handle chatintegrations commands via browser instead of the VR interface ...

# Usage
+ just open the index.html in your favorite browser
  + heck it even works on a smartphone (not recommendable atm)
+ pretty much the same like in BS Plus, but with a download button, to download the Chatintegrations.json
+ place the json file in steamapps\common\Beat Saber\UserData\BeatSaberPlus\ChatIntegrations.json and you are good to go
+ make sure to have a backup, if you already have settings

# Todos
+ probably some refactoring of the index.html ... but who cares ...
+ generate select options from enums
+ globals ....
+ styling the UI probs
+ add an option to work with existing settings
+ voiceattack is still not in here
